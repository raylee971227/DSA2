# DSA2
All programs written in this repository was meant for the ECE-365 course at The Cooper Union

Contents:

1. HashTable - Implementation of a hash table just for shits and giggles.
2. spell - Project 1 for DSA2. Contents include an implementation of a hash table to hold dictionary words. Main will use this hash table to spell check words in a text file.
3. Heap - Project 2 for DSA2. Contents include an implementation of a binary heap.
4. Dijkstra - Project 3 for DSA2. Contents include a graph class that holds functionalities in order to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm.
5. Merge- Project 4 for DSA2. This program is a solution for the 1998 ACM problem (http://acmgnyr.org/year1998/prob_g.html) using a dynamic programming approach.
